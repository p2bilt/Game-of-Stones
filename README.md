# Game of Stones
A Demo React Clickity-Click Game

## Overview

In this project, I create a simple memory game with React. The goal was to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

Try out this thrilling game for yourself at [https://game-of-stones.herokuapp.com/](https://game-of-stones.herokuapp.com/)

### Instructions

1. The application renders a dozen different Infinity Gem images to the screen. 

2. Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The task for the user is to click on each image once and only once. 

3. The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, their Gems Collected score is incremented

4. If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked on in the current round, their Gems Collected score is reset to 0, and the game begins again.

5. The application keeps track of the users Best Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new Best Score.
